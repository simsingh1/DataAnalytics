# Project Overview

## Association Rule Analysis

This project focuses on implementing association rule mining techniques to analyze data patterns. The Jupyter Notebook `Singh_Singh Code.ipynb` contains Python code demonstrating the use of association rules in data analysis.

### Key Components
- **Frequent Itemsets Identification**: Identification of frequent two-itemsets along with their support values.
- **Association Rule Generation**: For all maximal length frequent itemsets, the notebook generates corresponding association rules that satisfy minimum confidence requirements.

## Data Analytics Project (IS 665, Fall 2023)

The project, as outlined in the `Project Problem To Be Solved.pdf` and `Project Problem Solved.pdf`, covers the following aspects:

### Part 1: Statistics Basics
- Analysis of ICU and non-ICU patients' data.
- Calculation of probabilities and likelihoods in a medical context.

### Implementation Details
- The Python code makes extensive use of libraries like `itertools` for combinatorics.
- The project involves practical applications of statistical concepts in real-world scenarios.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed with necessary libraries (e.g., itertools).
2. **Running the Notebook**: Open `Singh_Singh Code.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially.
3. **Understanding the PDFs**: Read through `Project Problem To Be Solved.pdf` and `Project Problem Solved.pdf` for contextual understanding of the statistical analysis.
